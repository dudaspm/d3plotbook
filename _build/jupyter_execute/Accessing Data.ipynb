    "In this notebook, we discuss how to access datasets within D3.js. There are two ways to accomplish this in our Jupyter Lab environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## d3-fetch\n",
    "The most straightforward way is to use [d3-fetch](https://github.com/d3/d3-fetch). \n",
    "\n",
    "**JavaScript**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "d3.csv(\"/path/to/file.csv\").then((data) => { })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python (Pandas) + d3-fetch\n",
    "The second way include d3-fetch, but processing the data first in python, saving the file, and then using d3.fetch. Typically, I will use a library called Pandas to do this, as it similar features to d3.js. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "data=pd.read_csv(\"/path/to/file.csv\")\n",
    "data.to_csv('newFile.csv', index = False, header=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**JavaScript**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "d3.csv(\"/path/to/newFile.csv\").then((data) => { })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros/Cons of Both\n",
    "There is little difference between the two, obviously you are adding another step with Python, but you get the added benefit of being able to use all of Python's tools before working with the file. Not to say D3.js does not have these similar capabilities. If anything, I (my preference) think D3.js are a bit better and easier to use, but this not the case for everyone. Let's showcase both. "
