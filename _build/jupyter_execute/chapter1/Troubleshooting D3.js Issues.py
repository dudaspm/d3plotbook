# # Troubleshooting D3.js Issues

# ## Preface
# 
# I have run into 1000's of issues during my development time with D3.js. This will be a growing document to express the issues that were more common and basics on debugging. 

# ## Debugging
# 
# I will provide a perspective from Chrome, but these ideas will carry through other browsers as well. 

# ### What is a debugger? 
# 
# There are much better places to learn more about debuggers, but at a high-level you use them to debug your code. Too be honest, it is mostly used to see errors or warning (usually, errors). Especially, when you are expecting to see something and that something does not show up. 

# #### Accessing the Debugger (Developer Tools)
# 
# When you have Chrome (or another browser open) and you create your code and...! Nothing happens. Your first stop should be, to find the Developer Tools.

# You can also use the short-cut:
# * Chrome:
#     * Shift + ⌘ + I (on macOS) or Ctrl + Shift + I (on Windows/Linux)
# * Firefox:
#     * Shift + ⌘ + I (on macOS) or Shift + CTRL + I (on Windows/Linux)
# 
# ```
