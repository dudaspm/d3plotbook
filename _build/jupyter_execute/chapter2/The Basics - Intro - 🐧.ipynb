    "         * As D3 stands for data-driven documents, your first real steps in D3.js should have some data. We start with a static, small array, but intro the connection between objects you will creating to the data itself. \n",
    "    * Style, Scales, and Shapes!\n",
    "         * OK, we have a small data set, now what? Not only can you use the data to think about creating objects, but all the other visual encodings you would expect. \n",
    "    * Accessing Data\n",
    "         * Let's expand what we know to a larger data set. This is a mostly Jupyter Lab/Google Colab context for bringing in data and making use of it in D3.js. We will discuss a couple of approach to this idea. \n",
    "    * Scaling, Legends, and Color\n",
    "         * We introduce more robust ways to scale data and its connection to legends and colors. \n",
    "    * Transitions\n",
    "         * Finally, we conconclude by discussing transitions, which can make data sets more lively and an engaging. Also, they can be a lot of fun!"
