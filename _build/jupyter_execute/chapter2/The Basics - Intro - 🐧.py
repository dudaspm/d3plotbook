# # The Basics - Intro - üêß

# These first notebooks will layout the foundation of D3.js. The expectation is that you are new to D3.js but have a minimal amount of programming knowledge in general. 
# 
# I consider these chapters the basic building blocks of D3.js, but if you have other suggestions of introductory material. Let me know! 
# 
# The way this section is layed out is to focus on what I would consider to be the essenstial parts of D3.js. 
# 
# * Chapter 2 - The Basics
#     * Now with data! - üê≥
#          * As D3 stands for data-driven documents, your first real steps in D3.js should have some data. We start with a static, small array, but intro the connection between objects you will creating to the data itself. 
#     * Style, Scales, and Shapes!
#          * OK, we have a small data set, now what? Not only can you use the data to think about creating objects, but all the other visual encodings you would expect. 
#     * Accessing Data
#          * Let's expand what we know to a larger data set. This is a mostly Jupyter Lab/Google Colab context for bringing in data and making use of it in D3.js. We will discuss a couple of approach to this idea. 
#     * Scaling, Legends, and Color
#          * We introduce more robust ways to scale data and its connection to legends and colors. 
#     * Transitions
#          * Finally, we conconclude by discussing transitions, which can make data sets more lively and an engaging. Also, they can be a lot of fun!
